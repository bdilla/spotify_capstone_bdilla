### Spotify Top 200 of 2020 Capstone

With streaming service data being the new industry standard I wanted to take a dive into the world of Spotify and check in with the Music Business in 2020!

### Scope of the Project
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive tool to analyze current streaming patterns and make predictions for the coming year. 

With this specific data set I wanted to take a look at how the top 200 artists compare across the globe whether within a specific song or the artist as a whole, how they relate to each other and pin point predictive measures for a particular artist, genre or location. 

### Why Spotify you ask?

Coming from a background in music business it has always been a passion of mine and I was very excited to be able to look at it from a whole new point of view. Spotify is a great resource for music data as they have become an industry standard for defining music trends across the US and globally. While the original intent was more of a fun exploration, I believe the end product is a valuable tool.

### Questions for Exploration
- What do streaming patterns look like in the year of 2020?
- How does streaming volume relate to population size?
- How do US listening trends compare globally?
- Who or What is dominating the market?
